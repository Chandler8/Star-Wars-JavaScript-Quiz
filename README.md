# Star-Wars-JavaScript-Quiz
This project is a responsive and living Star Wars trivia style quiz that relies heavily on the implementation of JavaScript. The user will find a smooth and clean interface that utilizes CSS Bootstrap mechanics to subtly place and organize all of the aesthetic aspects of the quiz. Upon clicking the start button the user will be presented with a series of questions that all have four possible answers. Along with this the user will also need to beat a timer that begins at 60 seconds upon the start of the quiz. The challenge is further heightened by the fact that the user will have their 60 seconds deducted by 15 seconds for every wrong answer they guess. Once the user has either answered all of the questions, or have seen the timer reach zero, they will be shown their score and prompted to input either their name or their initials. The user will then be directed to a results page that displays their name/initials along with their score. This method takes advantage of the local storage that a user has on their web browser. Within this results page the user will be able to see their top five scores in a sequential order from highest ever score to lowest ever score. As the page is only programmed to hold the top five scrores at any one time, the user is given an option to 'clear' the listed scores and start fresh.
